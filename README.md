# PROJECT-Wearable-Navigation-Aid-for-Visually-Impaired-Individuals-Using-LiDAR-and-Raspberry-Pi-Zero
## Introduction
<p align="justify">
    Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in navigating their surroundings, often leading to
    accidents and reduced independence. Traditional mobility aids like canes provide limited information about the
    environment, primarily detecting obstacles at ground level. There is a need for a more advanced solution that can
    detect obstacles at various heights and provide real-time feedback to enhance mobility and safety. Central to this
    transformation is the "Wearable Navigation Aid for Visually Impaired Individuals Using LiDAR and Raspberry Pi Zero,"
    which embodies the blend of convenience, safety, and innovation. Leveraging the capabilities of LiDAR sensors, a
    Raspberry Pi Zero, MPU sensors, GPS, GSM modules, servo motors, and ESP32, this project offers practical solutions
    to everyday challenges, enhancing the way visually impaired individuals interact with their environment.

    Traditional methods of navigation for the visually impaired can be cumbersome, tiresome, and inefficient. This
    technology eliminates such challenges by allowing users to navigate their surroundings with real-time obstacle
    detection and haptic feedback, reducing the need for physical interaction. The wearable navigation aid can be
    utilized in a wide range of applications, from enhancing mobility and safety to providing location tracking and
    emergency communication features, significantly improving the quality of life for visually impaired individuals and
    simplifying everyday tasks across diverse environments.
